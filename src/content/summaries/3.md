submarket: 3
---
Submarket 3 is composed of moderate-density communities with the regionâ€™s oldest housing stock. On average, 3 out of every 4 housing units in Submarket 3 communities were built in or before 1959. The submarket has average home prices and rents, along with moderate levels of foreclosures, business buyer sales, and cash sales. Households are mostly low-to-moderate income, and renters make up most of the residents in this submarket. However, the share of renters has declined since the year 2000, on par with Submarket 1. As Submarket 3 has become more owner-occupied, both home prices and rents have undergone above average increases.
