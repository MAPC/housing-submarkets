submarket: 1
---
Submarket 1 is comprised of dense inner core communities within parts of Boston, Cambridge, Brookline and Medford. Residents in this submarket have moderate-to-high household incomes, and nearly two-thirds of residents rent. The housing stock in Submarket 1 is generally older, with most structures built before 1959. Submarket 1 is also the highest density submarket in the region, with 5+ unit buildings comprising, on average, roughly 70% of all housing buildings in Submarket 1 communities. Rents are the highest in the region, and home prices are second only to the affluent suburbs that comprise Submarket 5. The submarket has low foreclosure activity, but high levels of business buyers and cash sales. Submarket 1 has seen the greatest increase in population, housing density, and rents in the region, the latter of which may partially explain why Submarket 1 also experienced the greatest decrease in renters over the same time period.
