In Submarket 2, home prices and rents are relatively low. Density is the highest in the region and getting higher. Submarket 2 areas are primarily concentrated in the regionâ€™s inner core, as well as in regional urban centers such as Framingham, Quincy, Peabody, and Gloucester. This submarket has the highest renter population and lowest household incomes of all submarkets, and roughly a tenth of its housing units are HUD subsidized, more than any other submarket. Submarket 2 also has the highest levels of foreclosure activity and business buyer sales, with a rate of cash sales second only to Submarket 1. Over the last two decades, Submarket 2 has experienced the greatest increase in home prices of all submarkets.
