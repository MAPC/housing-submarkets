submarket: 2
---
Submarket 2 consists of communities primarily concentrated in the regionâ€™s inner core, along with parts of regional urban centers such as Framingham, Quincy, Peabody, and Gloucester. Home prices and rents are relatively low, while housing density is among the highest in the region. Submarket 2 has the highest renter population and lowest household incomes of all submarkets, and roughly a tenth of housing units in Submarket 2 communities are HUD subsidized, more than any other submarket. Submarket 2 also has the highest levels of foreclosure activity and business buyer sales, and the rate of cash sales is second only to Submarket 1. Over the last two decades, the submarket has experienced the greatest increase in home prices of all submarkets and is seeing above average increases in population and housing density.
