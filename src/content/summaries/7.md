submarket: 7
---
Submarket 7 is the lowest-density submarket, and is comprised of mostly single-family homes. Submarket 7 areas form a semi-circle around the region in municipalities such as Topsfield, Sudbury, Sharon, and Norwell. Home prices are moderate, but residents of the region are relatively wealthy, with the second-highest average incomes after Submarket 5. Most residents of Subregion 7 own their homes. Although there are few rental opportunities, rental prices are relatively low for the region. The volume of home sales in this submarket has grown faster than most of the region, however sale prices have increased the least of the seven submarkets. With stable moderately-priced housing options, it is perhaps not surprising that Submarket 7 has the lowest housing-unit vacancy rate of the submarkets.
