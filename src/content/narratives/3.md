submarket: 3
---
Submarket 3 occurs in moderate-density urban communities like Dorchester, Somerville, Lynn, and Waltham. Housing stock in this submarket is dominated by smaller multifamily homes, including the region’s iconic triple-deckers. It also has the region’s oldest housing stock—on average, three out of every four housing units in Submarket 3 were built in or before 1959. Home prices and rents are average for the region, but both have seen above average increases since 2000. Households are mostly low-to-moderate income, and as in Submarket 1, renters make up most of the residents – although the share of renters has declined over the last twenty years. Foreclosures are an issue in Submarket 2, but they occur at a moderate rate, as do business buyer sales, and cash sales.
