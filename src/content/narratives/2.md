submarket: 2
---
In Submarket 2, home prices and rents are relatively low. Density is the second highest in the region and getting higher. Submarket 2 areas are primarily concentrated in the regionâ€™s inner core, as well as in regional urban centers such as Framingham, Quincy, Peabody, and Gloucester. This submarket has the highest share of renters of all submarkets, and roughly a tenth of its housing units are HUD subsidized, more than any other submarket. Submarket 2 also has high levels of foreclosure activity and the highest share of business buyer sales, with a rate of cash sales second only to Submarket 1. Despite its low costs, Submarket 2 has experienced the second greatest increase in home sale prices over the last two decades, after Submarket 1.
