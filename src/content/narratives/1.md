submarket: 1
---
Submarket 1 is comprised of dense urban communities with moderate-to-high household-income residents. Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, and Medford all have Submarket 1 areas. This submarket’s housing stock is generally older, with most structures built before 1959. It’s also the highest-density submarket in the region: roughly 70% of its housing buildings have five or more units. Nearly two thirds of this submarket’s housing stock is comprised of rental units, although that proportion is dropping. Rents are the highest in the region, and home prices are second only to those in Subregion 5’s affluent suburbs. Submarket 1 has low foreclosure activity, many business buyers, and cash sales. Over the past 20 years, this submarket has seen the greatest increase in population and housing density of any in the region.
