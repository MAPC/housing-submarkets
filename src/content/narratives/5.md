submarket: 5

Submarket 5 is the most affluent submarket in the region, and with average home prices approaching $1 million, it has some of the region’s most expensive homes. Submarket 5 areas can be found in wealthy suburbs such as Lincoln, Weston, and Dover, as well as in old, established streetcar suburbs like Newton and Brookline. The housing stock is old and large. Most homes were built before 1960, and most are single-family homes with three or more bedrooms. Though homes are expensive, prices have increased only moderately since 2000 compared to other submarkets. Despite this submarket’s premium prices, its volume of sales has increased on average, while in all but one other submarket, sales have, on average, declined –sometimes steeply. Less than 20 percent of households rent their home, and rents in the submarket are second highest only to Submarket 1. Submarket 5 saw the largest decline in renter households of the seven submarkets since 2000.
